                    <h3>Why you should watch Burning</h3>
                    <p> Burning (in Hangul: 버닝), directed in 2018 by Lee Chang-Dong, is a psychological thriller
                        which features actors Steven Yeun, Yooh Ah-in, and Jeon Jong-seo. Yooh plays Jong-su, a down-on-his-luck 
                        deliveryman who randomly meets his childhood friend Hae-mi, played by Jong-seo.  The two reconnect and develop a sense of trust,
                        so Hae-mi leaves Jong-su to take care of her apartment and cat during a trip to Africa.  Hae-mi bonds with a
                        mysterious man, Ben (played by Steven Yeun) after being temporarily stranded at the airport during her return trip. 
                        Ben becomes increasingly immersed in their lives, with Hae-mi seemingly mesmerized by his glamorous and wealthy lifestyle,
                        while Jong-su grows increasingly suspicious at some of Ben's activities, including a bi-monthly ritual wherein he burns an
                        abandoned greenhouse.  Eventually, Hae-mi disappears along with her cat: just as the South Korean police don't take interest in
                        the greenhouses Ben burns down, they don't care for Hae-mi's disappearance, as she has no other friends or family, leading Jong-su
                        to take matters into his own hands.  Burning is a deeply unsettling movie, particularly during the latter half, where Ben's mysteriously
                        funded high-speed lifestyle contrasts sharply with the mystery surrounding his job, history, and morality.  Ben is an enigmatic character,
                        and Steven Yeun masterfully plays the role of a sculking siren; the facade of a man which barely conceals a writhing darkness and amorality that occassionally
                        slithers out from beneath the mask.  The movie leaves the audience with more questions than answers, tormenting them to a similar fate as Jong-su. 
                        Burning radiates dread and mystery, yet it's a riveting and immersive watch with likable (but flawed) main characters in Jong-su and Hae-mi, and an unknowable force of
                        nature in Ben, which I really enjoyed.
